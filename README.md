Applying Machine Learning Concepts on Irish Flower Dataset using Sci-Kit


We start by creating Hello World project in ML. Here it not literally Hello World but using supervised method and two features. We identify wheather a fruit is apple or orange.

Next we visualize the tree to understand how the DecisionTree takes decision. Code provided will generate pdf file of the logic used on the dataset of Iris Flower.

Next up we decide on important features to be included in a domain by analyzing data plotting a graph to undesratnd its impact. We have taken example of dog's height as we are focusing on identify difference between Dog Breed GreyHound and Labrador.

We then compare the Irish dataset using various techinique like KNeighbor and Decision Tree etc.. to measure the accuracy of the data being learned.
